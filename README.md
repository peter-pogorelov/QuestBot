Telegram Game Engine â€” Create Your Own Telegram Text Game
==================================================


Our Dream
--------------------------------------
Telegram Game Engine (TGE) is the embodiment of the idea of games accessible to everyone: any device, any operating system. We crave to develop a product could implement any ideas and dreams. We hope that TGE and TGE's games will be exciting to play and to develop!

What You Need To Know
--------------------------------------
TGE is an engine for text games launched in Telegram. It is written in Java and uses JSON for storing the games.

Rules for developers
--------------------------------------
We strive to establish a clear and transparent process of the development of the TGE. That's why we have some rules that help us to follow the right direction deloping our software.
- Decisions are made by a simple majority (>=50%). Now our community consists of about dozen of people that's why we can afford ourselves to vote in our [Telegram chat](https://telegram.me/joinchat/Cgfq7T90hVE9YGfrHsEasQ). If the number of participants will grow we will find another platform for voting.
- The new code should be published in the dev branch. The project isn't too big to create parallel versions, therefore it's enough one branch for storing current code. 
- The stable version is published in the master branch. It has name like X.X.
- Current bugs are located in the tracker on GitHub.
- Unit test are written before the releasing a stable version.
- Suggestions are located in the issues. After that we disscuss them in our [Telegram chat](https://telegram.me/joinchat/Cgfq7T90hVE9YGfrHsEasQ).
- Format of commits: name of commit = name of feature. In the description should be specified an algorithm, changes, and possible influence of this commit. For non-trivial changes it would be better to create Unit tests. Commits should be associated with issues.
- Manual could be found in the Wiki section.
